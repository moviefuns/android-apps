# Changelog

All notable changes to Nóta are documented here.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- Removed deprecated `windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode="shortEdges"` from theme — handled automatically by `enableEdgeToEdge()`

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- Critical bug: spaces and line breaks could not be typed in the note editor (caused by image-placeholder display transform)
- Markdown toolbar was hidden behind the on-screen keyboard — now anchored above it with `imePadding()`

### Added
- GPL v3 license
- Localization support — strings externalized to `res/values/strings.xml`, Weblate-ready structure for future community translations
- In-app text size setting (Small / Default / Large / Extra Large) in Settings → Display, scales typography across the entire app
