# Qarib

**A "want to visit" places app with Nextcloud sync and geofence notifications.**

Qarib (قريب — Arabic for "nearby") is a free, open-source Android app for saving places you want to visit and getting notified when you're close to one. No cloud account required to use it locally; optionally sync your places to Nextcloud via WebDAV.

Part of the [BARBURAS](https://barburas.com) open-source Android suite.

## A note on place names and territories

Qarib does not decide how places, countries, or territories are named. It displays addresses and details as returned by the data source it queries (Nominatim / OpenStreetMap). Any naming of disputed or contested territories reflects that source, not a position taken by the app or its developer.
