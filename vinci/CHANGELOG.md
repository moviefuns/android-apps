## [1.3.4]
### Added
- Multi-device restore: interactions and starred contacts now restore correctly on a second device (tablet, new phone).
- Restore screen shows progress while importing and a summary when complete.
- New "Sync starred to Nextcloud" button in Settings — pushes starred contacts and follow-ups to Nextcloud, with a spinner and confirmation message.
- Each interaction file now embeds the contact identifier, making restore reliable across devices regardless of how contacts were synced.
- Both plain and bold field formats are now supported when reading older interaction files.

### Fixed
- Deleted interactions are now removed from Nextcloud so they no longer reappear after a restore.
- Starring or unstarring a contact now syncs to Nextcloud immediately.
- Restore and sync actions now show a Snackbar notification when starting and when complete.

## [1.1.9]
### Fixed

### Fixed
- Social Media interactions now correctly save and display the selected platform (was storing a literal backslash due to a string escape bug).

## [1.1.7]
### Added
- "Social Media" interaction type with platform picker (LinkedIn, Instagram, GitHub, etc.) and correct brand icons in interaction lists.

## [1.1.6] / [1.1.5]
### Fixed

### Fixed
