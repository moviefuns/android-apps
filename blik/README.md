# Blik

**Blik** is a privacy-first screenshot manager for Android that connects to your own Nextcloud server. Take a screenshot, and Blik finds it, helps you organize it, and backs it up to your self-hosted cloud — with no third-party servers, no ads, and your data stays yours.

Available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brbrs.blik).

## Features

### Library
- Two-column screenshot gallery with upload status badges
- Filter by: All, Pending, Uploaded, Notes, ⭐ Starred, and AI-assigned categories
- Search across filenames, notes, tags, and AI descriptions
- Long-press to enter multi-select — upload, delete, blur, or star multiple screenshots at once

### Upload to Nextcloud
- Connect via Nextcloud Login Flow v2 — no passwords typed into the app
- Pick your destination folder using a built-in WebDAV folder browser
- Upload individually, in bulk, or automatically in the background
- Constraints: Wi-Fi only, charging only
- Conflict handling: Ask / Skip / Overwrite

### AI Organization
- Works with your own Claude or OpenAI API key
- Generates a description, assigns a category (travel, food, technology, etc.), and suggests tags in a single API call
- Automatically sorts uploads into category subfolders on Nextcloud
- Can run automatically on upload or on demand per screenshot

### Per-Screenshot Tools
- Add notes, tags, and Tasks.org tasks
- Star important screenshots and filter to starred only
- Privacy blur — blurs the thumbnail in the gallery (display only, nothing changes on file)
- Fullscreen viewer with pinch-to-zoom
- View file metadata: size, SHA-256 hash, remote path

### Nextcloud Tab
- Pulls the full list of files from your Nextcloud Screenshots folder via PROPFIND
- Shows thumbnails — local copy if available, loaded directly from Nextcloud if remote-only
- Badge per file: 📱 local or ☁️ remote only
- Tap for info sheet, long-press for multi-select, delete from Nextcloud directly

### Smart Deletion
- Pending screenshot: delete from phone
- Uploaded screenshot: delete from phone only, Nextcloud only, or both
- Files deleted externally (via Files or Gallery app) are detected on next scan and marked as cloud-only

### Security
- Optional biometric lock
