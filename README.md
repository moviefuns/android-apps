## Philosophy

These apps are built for people who:
- Run their own Nextcloud instance or other self-hosted services
- Care about where their data lives
- Want beautiful, native Android apps that don't compromise on privacy

Every app in this suite:
- Communicates only with your own server
- Collects no analytics or telemetry
- Contains no ads
- Works offline first

## Tech Stack

All apps share the same foundation:

- **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose** + **Material Design 3**
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Room** for offline-first local storage
- **DataStore** for preferences
- **OkHttp** + **org.json** for networking (no Retrofit/Gson)
- **Coil** for image loading
- **Nextcloud Login Flow v2** for authentication
